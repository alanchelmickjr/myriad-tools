# Myriad AI Toolbox üõ†Ô∏è
#### powered by the Ethical Responsible Ai Consortium (E.R.A.C.) 

Welcome to the MyriadAi Toolbox! This repository contains a collection of powerful tools that extend the functionality of AI models available at [MyriaDAI](https://myriadai.online). These tools allow you to interact with various APIs and perform internet searches to retrieve and manipulate data seamlessly. 

As always, use ethically and responsibly please, it keeps the government from making us track everything you do.  In the Builder/Pro version you can drag and drop these tools with no code. 

## During this BETA testing phase while we build the tools be free to test.  This tool is functioning and an API Key will be required in 3 days, best to grab your key now at https://www.multion.ai/ and put in the the headers section, more examples coming soon.  Without this key you will need a subscription to access the Internet directly with your models.
